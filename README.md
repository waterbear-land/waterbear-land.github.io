The **Waterbear Collective** helps to develop technological sovereignty and coooperation among communities impacted by environmental or infrastructural challenges: including vulnerable cities, rural townships, farming communities, and islands.

We facilitate workshops, trainings, and collaborative development focused on building locally-owned, resilient municipal and community infrastructure using an open, collaborative design process.  Recent projects include:

- resilient communication systems
- off-grid water monitoring (flood, drought, salinity)
- retrofitting greenhouse control systems 
- capturing soil health data from remote farm fields

You can view all of our designs and code on <a href="http://github.com/edgecollective">github</a>.
